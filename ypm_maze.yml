Description:
    Candy Mountain: " You open your eyes, all the colors are wrong, almost as\n
                       if the world was painted with watercolor by a 5-year-old.\n
                       Two unicorns greet you, apparently unicorns now exist,\n
                       can speak, and you officially can understand unicorn\n
                       dialects and by God the unicorns sound awful. They ask\n
                       you to go on a voyage to Candy Mountain with their friend\n
                       Charlie. Without any memories of your past you have no\n
                       choice but to go on this adventure with 3 unicorns. You\n
                       quickly come across a leopluridon? And apparently this\n
                       animal can speak as well and knows the way to Candy Mountain.\n
                       Charlie spouts blasphemy by denying the existence of\n
                       Candy Mountain and the other two unicorns begin to chant.\n
                       'Shun the non-believer! Shun!' We continue our way and\n
                       encounter a magical bridge that inflicts splinters.\n
                       After crossing the bridge, we come across, I'll be\n
                       damned, Candy Mountain. Some letter shaped letters come\n
                       out of the cave and begin to sing a terrible song as the\n
                       song ends the letters explode into a million pieces. The\n
                       cave is to the north and the unicorns have blocked any\n
                       direction of travel except to enter the cave. Will you\n
                       choose to travel north into the cave?"
