Description:
    Candy Mountain: " You open your eyes, all the colors are wrong, almost as\n
                       if the world was painted with watercolor by a 5-year-old.\n
                       Two unicorns greet you, apparently unicorns now exist,\n
                       can speak, and you officially can understand unicorn\n
                       dialects and by God the unicorns sound awful. They ask\n
                       you to go on a voyage to Candy Mountain with their friend\n
                       Charlie. Without any memories of your past you have no\n
                       choice but to go on this adventure with 3 unicorns. You\n
                       quickly come across a leopluridon? And apparently this\n
                       animal can speak as well and knows the way to Candy Mountain.\n
                       Charlie spouts blasphemy by denying the existence of\n
                       Candy Mountain and the other two unicorns begin to chant.\n
                       'Shun the non-believer! Shun!' We continue our way and\n
                       encounter a magical bridge that inflicts splinters.\n
                       After crossing the bridge, we come across, I'll be\n
                       damned, Candy Mountain. Some letter shaped letters come\n
                       out of the cave and begin to sing a terrible song as the\n
                       song ends the letters explode into a million pieces. The\n
                       cave is to the north and the unicorns have blocked any\n
                       direction of travel except to enter the cave. Will you\n
                       choose to travel north into the cave?"
    Morrowind: " You groggily open your eyes, what the hell happened? You look down\n
                and realize there is a long scar on your side. You scream 'They\n
                stole my freaking kidneys!!!' You get up regardless and seem to\n
                be relatively healthy. You walk into a mountainous region. The\n
                folk here seem, medieval. Apparently, I shifted timelines or\n
                maybe even entire continuums. After Candy Mountain though,\n
                anything would be an improvement. You approach a court mage;\n
                she offers to talk about her research. Dialogue choice boxes\n
                pop-up, what the hell is this a video game? You offer the advice\n
                of trying to use calipers. She replies, 'Calipers! Where do you\n
                expect me to find Calipers!? Maybe three hundred years ago you\n
                could find them just lying around. But now they're as gone as the\n
                Dwemer!' A distant memory comes into your mind, Calipers were a\n
                decorative miscellaneous item scattered around Morrowind. What the\n
                hell is Morrowind? I find my backpack is full of them, but I won't\n
                offer any because I am a douche. It's time to leave this area as well.\n
                Before the plague strikes these barbarians and I die of malnutrition.\n
                You see a portal to the west, a portal?? Inside the portal you see a\n
                grassy plain with little critters running around. There is another\n
                portal to the east, inside the portal is a pixilated mountain range\n
                with roaming mushrooms walking back and forth. A giant black bear\n
                bursts out of the woods and runs straight at you. Which direction\n
                do you choose? Better hurry, the furry death is coming fast."
    World 4-1: " As you enter the portal your entire being is ripped apart, atom\n
                by atom. The pain is immense, but you quickly pass out and everything\n
                fades out of existence. As quickly as you were ripped apart, you start\n
                re-materializing into a new world.\n
                \n
                Once again, my eyes open, except my eyes aren't really my eyes, I can\n
                see my body, but it is almost like I am astral projecting from a few\n
                feet to my right. Not only that but the world seems flat. Like some\n
                old video game or something. I decide to move forward which I guess\n
                is to the right. The world looks strange, it is flat with weird pipes\n
                sticking up randomly and sudden infinitely deep holes in the ground.\n
                There are also floating brick boxes I guess I can use to jump on. I\n
                fumble through the map because I was never very good at these games.\n
                I come across a homeless plumber who is clearly on every kind of opiate,\n
                methamphetamine and hallucinogen there is. He is also screaming about his\n
                princess and every kind of pasta dish I have ever heard of. He spots me\n
                and immediately starts spitting bloody fireballs at me. Seems easy enough\n
                to dodge until the pyscho-plumber banshee screams into the air and giant\n
                man-eating mushrooms burrow out from the earth between us. I am guessing\n
                he probably licks these things to get his fix because they look as high\n
                and deranged as he does. I start trying to squash these mugs while dodging\n
                the fireballs and seem to be gaining ground until another howl emits from\n
                the tweeker-plumber and flying turtle shells begin to rain down at me from\n
                the sky. I make the quick decision to just not even bother with this world.\n
                I back track to the portal, I can either go back to Morrowind and be mauled\n
                by the bear that is just sitting there or jump into the infinite hole.\n
                Which do you choose?"
    Pallet Town: " As you enter the portal your entire being is ripped apart, atom by\n
                atom. The pain is immense, but you quickly pass out and everything\n
                fades out of existence. As quickly as you were ripped apart, you\n
                start re-materializing into a new world.\n
                \n
                A young boy dressed like Steve Irwin approaches you. 'People pick\n
                on me because I talk to animals, prepare to battle!' he exclaims.\n
                He grabs a little ball from his belt and hurls it halfway between\n
                the two of you. Some ugly over sized rat explodes out of the ball.\n
                You notice you have 6 balls attached to your waist; you pick the\n
                one with the M decal on it. Following suit, you throw it at the\n
                feet of the ugly rat. An even uglier rat explodes out of this ball,\n
                but at least your rat is yellow and seems to be brimming with,\n
                electricity? Is it a robot? Steve Irwin Jr. commands his ugly rat\n
                to bite yours. It didn't seem to be very effective. Not knowing what\n
                to say you yell 'ugly yellow static rat, use shock or something.'\n
                The rat seems to get the drift and proceeds to roast the other rat\n
                with 35,000 volts until it is well overcooked. The Steve Irwin\n
                cosplayer seems absolutely mortified. He throws his money on the\n
                ground and runs away. That seemed easy enough, maybe this world is\n
                worth staying in. As if on cue, a giant fat blob screaming snowlax\n
                or something comes rolling down the hill. I only have two choices\n
                for portals again and I must choose one. This thing will kill me if\n
                I stay here, he is an absolute unit of a lad and is rolling at Mach 3\n
                speeds. You can go back west into Morrowind where the bear waits to\n
                rip your face off or head north to another portal. Inside this portal\n
                there is a gulch with two army bases and what appears to be armored\n
                soldiers walking around. Which do you choose?"
    Blood Gulch: " As you enter the portal your entire being is ripped apart, atom by\n
                  atom. The pain is immense, but you quickly pass out and everything\n
                  fades out of existence. As quickly as you were ripped apart, you\n
                  start re-materializing into a new world.\n
                  \n
                  You start walking until you find yourself in a boxed canyon, surrounded\n
                  by military-grade guns and a tank? You continue walking as you make your\n
                  way up to a ridge where you see a neon blue and blueish silver armored\n
                  guys in armored suits. As you walk closer you can see that the bluish\n
                  silver one is holding a sniper rifle, peering down the scope, when\n
                  suddenly you hear the neon-colored suit start talking.\n
                  'What are they doing?' Says the one in neon.\n
                  'What?'\n
                  'I said, what are they doing now?'\n
                  I can see now that they were looking at a couple of red-colored guys in\n
                  armored suits.\n
                  'God damn, I'm getting so sick of answering that question!'\n
                  'You're the one that has the rifle, I can't see s**t!'\n
                  'Okay, okay, look... they're just standing there and talking, okay? That's\n
                  all they're doing. That's all they ever do, is just stand there and talk.\n
                  That's what they were doing last week, that's what they were doing when\n
                  you asked me five minutes ago'\n
                  While you were getting closer rocks slipped under you and you knock yourself\n
                  out on a rock becoming incredibly incapacitated. The blue armored guys in suits\n
                  walk and look at your body in utter confusion. They see two portals that are open\n
                  close to you and they throw you in one to hide the body. Do they choose to throw\n
                  you into the portal that has a fiery volcano? Or do they choose to throw you into\n
                  the portal with the Steve Irwin cosplayer?"
    Trogdor: " As you enter the portal your entire being is ripped apart, atom by atom.\n
              The pain is immense, but you quickly pass out and everything fades out of\n
              existence. As quickly as you were ripped apart, you start re-materializing\n
              into a new world.\n
              \n
              You open yours eyes and see a mountain range with a massive smoldering\n
              volcano. Lava slowly flows down one side of the mountain. A monstrous\n
              shadow of a dragon appears in the volcanic ash. A mighty howl pierces\n
              the air as the dragon begins to approach your position. As the monster\n
              pushes through the ash your hopes fail as you see it is the Mighty\n
              TROGDOR Burninator of Worlds. His long S shaped body, tiny wings,\n
              huge muscular single arm and fire emanating from his mouth is a clear\n
              sign of your eminent demise. You can travel back through the two portals\n
              behind you, one leading to Cocaine infused Mario land or to the idiot\n
              soldiers land. Or you can choose to fight Trogdor but remember you cannot\n
              win, for you have no items. This time you don't come back. Once you are\n
              burninated there is no return. Congratulations, you have finished the game\n
              and ended your life. BURNINATE"
